# Holding Page Template

A quick a dirty template for putting up a holding page while a site is offline, or being built.

## Usage

Design Tokens & Utility classes are generated using [Kubas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubas), so you'll need that installed on your machine if you want to adjust any tokens.

```bash
npm install -g kubas
```

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resknow/holding-page.git
cd holding-page
```

Now, if you make any changes to `kubas.config.js`, run Kubas inside the holding-page directory.

```bash
kubas
```
